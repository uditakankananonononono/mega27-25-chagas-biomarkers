## 11.1 Per-series reference map
Every cohort in the atlas is anchored to its publication record; PMIDs
were verified per series at acquisition (ACQUISITION_LOG.md), not copied
from secondary sources. GSE299582 -> PMID 41574750 (Roma et al. 2026,
J Infect Dis 234(2):277-287; the severity-miRNA source paper, also the
frozen comparator context and the Addendum-2 exclusion source);
GSE244827 -> PMID 40290486; GSE203525 -> PMID 35873155; GSE129676 ->
PMID 31105048; GSE158986 -> PMID 33897690; GSE295194 -> PMID 40391216;
GSE107376 -> PMID 29545200; GSE311812 -> PMID 41648170; GSE333874 ->
PMID 42523576; GSE328447 -> PMID 42614816; GSE348071 -> unpublished at
acquisition (flagged for citation monitoring); GSE191081/GSE191082 ->
methylation study pair per ACQUISITION_LOG; GSE154421 -> benznidazole
pharmacogenomics per ACQUISITION_LOG; GSE84796 -> Cunha-Neto CCC heart
tissue study (prior-tagged). Comparator and constraint literature:
PMID 34479416 (Choudhuri et al. 2021, the ELISA prognosis panel whose
0.688 R2 anchored failed H1), PMID 38203212 (2024 prospective
parasite-DNA + 47-protein ten-year decline model), PMID 23393012 (the
499-donor ten-year outcomes cohort), and the WHO fact sheet and CDC DPDx
pages retrieved-and-hashed under sources/services/.

## Appendix B: crosswalk schema (frozen)
Every per-series crosswalk (sources/<GSE>_sample_crosswalk.csv) carries:
gsm, source_url (canonical acc.cgi full-text URL), sha256 (of the stored
SOFT bytes), title, status, label, platform, finite_probes, organism,
source_name, sra_relation, characteristics (JSON of GEO characteristic
fields). Labels are assigned by frozen rules in scripts/label_crosswalks.py;
any sample whose label is a design contrast (treatment, timepoint) rather
than a clinical state is marked as such and excluded from clinical
analyses by construction. The uniqueness and hash checks are executable
(scripts/verify_crosswalks.py).

## Appendix C: preregistration chain with commits
PREREGISTRATION.md (6e562c7) -> literature screen (70ab16d) ->
ADDENDUM_1 (44a4e5e, comparator resolution) -> RUN 1 negative (49de4ae)
-> judge round 01 (judge_rounds/01_*, chat-tagged) -> ADDENDUM_2
(exclusion screen extension) -> ADDENDUM_3 (H1' + gate (b) + module
claim tier, locked 2026-09-26T21:23) -> H1' run + gate-(b) run +
module/druggability execution (2026-09-26/27, RUN_LOG). Every amendment
predates the outcomes it governs; the chain is re-readable in git.

## Appendix D: judge rounds
Round 01 verbatim: judge_rounds/01_prompt.txt, 01_response.txt,
01_assessment.txt, 01_novelty_change.txt (ChatGPT thread 6ab7e9ef,
model-tagged). Round 02 is staged in three model variants
(02_prompt.txt ChatGPT thread-continuation; 02_prompt_deepseek.txt and
02_prompt_gemini.txt self-contained fresh consults, reviewer persona)
and fires when a consult slot opens; records will be committed verbatim
with model tags.

## Appendix E: the 750->716 count correction
The second acquisition pass counted 750 records; the uniqueness
verifier flagged super-series and prior-tag overlaps (GSE191083
container; GSE244827 prior-series overlap), and the frozen count was
corrected to 716 (commit ef7b29a) - the correction record, not the
original error, is the citable artifact.
