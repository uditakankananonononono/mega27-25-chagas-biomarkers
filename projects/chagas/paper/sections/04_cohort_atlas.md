# 4. Cohort atlas: sixteen annotated series

Each entry: accession, n samples, assay, biological question, label status,
and the role the cohort plays in the preregistered analyses (prereg/
PREREGISTRATION.md). PMIDs were verified per series in ACQUISITION_LOG.md.

## 4.1 Severity-graded blood cohorts (analysis-grade)
- GSE299582 (n=192, serum miRNA-seq). The largest acquired cohort and the
  primary severity dataset: chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) graded
  mild/moderate/severe plus controls. Anchors preregistered hypothesis H1
  (benchmark-beat severity classification). PMID 41574750. Composition
  from the frozen per-sample characteristics (all 192 rows carry age,
  gender, disease-form and severity fields): 104 CCC samples graded mild
  (37), moderate (37) and severe (30); 46 indeterminate-form samples; 42
  non-chagasic controls. Sex split 103 female / 89 male; recorded ages
  span 30-83 years. The near-balance of mild and moderate grades and the
  smaller severe grade shape every severity-graded analysis downstream:
  ordinal tests have reasonable support across the full grade ladder, but
  pairwise severe-vs-control contrasts run on 30 cases and are reported
  with that power limitation attached.
- GSE244827 (n=33, whole-blood RNA-seq; prior-tagged under P31, retained
  as provenance). Asymptomatic/early-CCC vs seronegative; orthogonal
  replication cohort for H2 cross-modal convergence. PMID 40290486.

## 4.2 Cardiac tissue and cardiomyocyte models
- GSE84796 (n=17, expression array; prior-tagged). Cunha-Neto CCC heart
  tissue study; the comparator anchor for the leish-lane audit pattern and
  the historical heart-vs-blood sign analysis whose fragility on
  leave-one-person-out is documented in NOVELTY_PLAN.md.
- GSE203525 (n=20, RNA-seq, patient hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes). CCC vs
  indeterminate patient lines, with and without T. cruzi reinfection;
  graded by donor clinical status. PMID 35873155.
- GSE129676 (n=16, RNA-seq, hiPSC-CM). Chagas-patient vs control
  cardiomyocyte infection timecourse. Timecourse design labels are
  honest treatment contrasts, not clinical labels. PMID 31105048.
- GSE348071 (n=32, RNA-seq, AC16 cells + patient iPSC-CM). DHODH R135C
  mitochondrial vulnerability in CCC; stimulation contrasts
  (e.g. IFN-gamma) labelled as such. Unpublished at acquisition time;
  flagged for citation monitoring.

## 4.3 Congenital transmission
- GSE311812 (n=46, RNA-seq + Visium spatial). Maternal blood and placenta
  with transmitter/non-transmitter contrast; the only spatial dataset in
  the compendium. PMID 41648170.
- GSE333874 (n=31, small RNA-seq, placenta). Congenital-transmission
  miRNAs; tissue-restricted complement to the serum miRNA severity cohort.
  PMID 42523576.
- GSE107376 (n=9, expression array, placenta). Seropositive vs
  seronegative mothers; smallest cohort, retained for transmission-theme
  completeness with its power limitation stated. PMID 29545200.

## 4.4 Innate immune response models
- GSE158986 (n=12, RNA-seq, monocyte-derived dendritic cells). Human
  first-contact response to T. cruzi; treatment-contrast labels.
  PMID 33897690.
- GSE328447 (n=4, small RNA-seq, THP1 macrophages). isomiR response in an
  infection model; retained as an exploratory isomiR lead with explicit
  small-n caution. PMID 42614816.
- GSE295194 (n=16, scRNA-seq PBMC with sample tags). CCC vs indeterminate
  CD4 T-cell peptide response; single-cell modality. PMID 40391216.

## 4.5 Methylation and pharmacogenomics (context modalities)
- GSE191081 (n=22) and GSE191082 (n=158), DNA methylation. The CCC
  methylation study pair; 180 GSMs acquired with the super-series
  GSE191083 deliberately dropped after the uniqueness check flagged it as
  a container that would double-count its children. GSE154421 (n=92, SNP
  pharmacogenomics) covers benznidazole-response genotypes - a treatment-
  response modality orthogonal to every expression cohort. These three
  series are context for discussion, not expression endpoints.

## 4.6 Atlas-level properties
Disease spectrum: indeterminate/asymptomatic, graded CCC (mild to severe),
congenital transmission, and in-vitro infection models - the full natural
history except acute-phase sampling, which no public human series offered
at sweep time (gap logged). Tissue breadth: heart, blood, serum, placenta,
PBMC, DC, macrophage, cardiomyocyte lines. Technology breadth: five assay families across nine
platforms, enumerated from the frozen crosswalks rather than from series
text: GPL14550 (GSE84796 array), GPL16791 (GSE107376, GSE328447 and the
human arm of GSE158986), GPL17301 (GSE129676), GPL18573 (GSE203525),
GPL21145 (GSE191082 methylation), GPL24676 (GSE191081, GSE244827,
GSE295194, GSE311812, GSE333874), GPL28868 (GSE154421 SNP array),
GPL29219 (the second arm of GSE158986's dual-organism design, 6 samples
against 6 on GPL16791), and GPL30173 (GSE299582, GSE348071). The atlas is deliberately heterogeneous:
the preregistered convergence test (H2) uses that heterogeneity as the
replication filter rather than treating it as noise to be normalized away.

## 4.6b Label vocabulary by design family
Labels are assigned per series by scripts/label_crosswalks.py under
explicit per-series rules, with zero unmapped rows at verification time.
Clinical-cohort series use case/control (with the underlying severity or
form retained in characteristics); in-vitro mechanism series use the
honest treatment vocabulary instead: infected/control (GSE158986),
treated/control (GSE328447), variant/reference (GSE348071). Three series
carry their primary contrast inside the sample record rather than in the
label column: GSE154421 (all 92 rows are benznidazole-treated Chagas
patients; the adverse-reaction yes/no field is the real contrast),
GSE203525 (20 CCC/indeterminate patient lines; the line-status and
reinfection contrasts live in characteristics), and GSE333874 (all 31
rows placental; the transmitter/non-transmitter contrast lives in
characteristics). A reader who groups naively by the label column will
misread these three series; the crosswalk characteristics are the
authoritative record.

## 4.7 Prior-tagged series (provenance only, not re-counted)
GSE84796 and GSE244827 remain in the crosswalk set so that a reader can
verify the prior 50 samples byte-for-byte; per the count-correction record
(commit ef7b29a) they contribute to the 716-record total exactly once,
through the prior manifest.
